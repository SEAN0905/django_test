# Django_test

This is a series of test apps using django to get myself familiarised with the framework.

In Project `test1`:

- `/test2/hello` will trigger a basic text return;
- `/test3` will provide an app that allows people to submit a form to publish a comment with their name.

In Project `proj2`:

The project is a live Todoist website that allows people to add in a new todoist, mark pre-existing ones as complete and delete completed or all Todoists.
